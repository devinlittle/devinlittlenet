I have been curious since I was realy young. I got my first computer given to me by my Uncle when I was 6 years old on Chrismas day. Ever since 5th grade and espesically durring quaritine, I found my hobby, programming. I frist started out making windows apps and roblox games during google meets and messing around with my computer. 

I then moved onto web development with the basics of html, and js. I kind of skiped learning css and I regret that because I really need to get better at css. Html is not a programing language but more of a design language to describe elements, css is a language to style and animate, and position said elemets, and javascript is an acutual programing languge. After learning the basics of thoes langauges I went to learn about linux and server administration. I've been messing with linux for aruond 4.5 years now and gotten super good at almost everything linux. I even moved my main os from windows to linux and got more proformance in games.

Now today I've tried to see what field of programming I like best. I've found that I really like making my own infastucture and that is why this website is self-hosted on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2. I also really love messing with databases and making an api work. The main langauges I'm intested right now are, [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and javascript. Javascript is pretty boring, but rust isn't I've been messing with rust on a Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) and the ESP32 (esp-wroom-32) and it has been fun. Rust is a low level langauge like C++ but with all the things I hate about C++ removed. It doesn't have a garbage collector unlike javascript and has something called the barrow checker. Im not gonna move too deep into that but rust is a fast and great programming language.
