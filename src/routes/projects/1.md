I have been curious since I was realy young. I got my first computer given to me by my Uncle when I was 6 years old on Chrismas day. Ever since 5th grade and espesically durring quaritine, I found my hobby, programming. I frist started out making windows apps and roblox games during google meets and messing around with my computer. 

I then moved onto web development with the basics of html, and js. I kind of skiped learning css and I regret that because I really need to get better at css. Html is not a programing language but more of a design language to describe elements, css is a language to style and animate, and position said elemets, and javascript is an acutual programing languge. After learning the basics of thoes langauges I went to learn about linux and server administration. I've been messing with linux for aruond 4.5 years now and gotten super good at almost everything linux. I even moved my main os from windows to linux and got more proformance in games.

Now today I've tried to see what field of programming I like best. I've found that I really like making my own infastucture and that is why this website is self-hosted on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2. I also really love messing with databases and making an api work. The main langauges I'm intested right now are, [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and javascript. Javascript is pretty boring, but rust isn't I've been messing with rust on a Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) and the ESP32 (esp-wroom-32) and it has been fun. Rust is a low level langauge like C++ but with all the things I hate about C++ removed. It doesn't have a garbage collector unlike javascript and has something called the barrow checker. Im not gonna move too deep into that but rust is a fast and great programming language. 

This website is made using Sveltekit, in javascript people have made frameworks to make building websites easier and better for the user. Using frameworks now websites can use components to have things like a navbar or a footer better to implement rather than putting the same elements on every html file. Frameworks also make reactivity a thing so when a user interacts with something the website will rerender. I've chosen to use SvelteKit as its called a meta framework. Meta frameworks have things like and api, routing, among other things. It gives a framework a lot more features and is better for almost any website.
