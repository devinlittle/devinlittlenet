I have been curious since I was realy young. I got my first computer given to me by my Uncle when I was 6 years old on Chrismas day. Ever since 5th grade and espesically durring quaritine, I found my hobby, programming. I frist started out making windows apps and roblox games during google meets and messing around with my computer. 


I then moved onto web development with the basics of html, and js. I kind of skiped learning css and I regret that because I really need to get better at css. Html is not a programing language but more of a design language to describe elements, css is a language to style and animate, and position said elemets, and javascript is an acutual programing languge. After learning the basics of thoes langauges U went to learn about linux and server administration. I've been messing with linux for aruond 4 years now and gotten super good at almost everything linux. I even moved my main os from windows to linux and got more proformance in games.

Now today I've tried to see what field of programming I like best.
